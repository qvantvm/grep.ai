# grep.ai
grep.ai is a native macOS app that lets you filter and explore log files using plain English. Describe what you’re looking for, and grep.ai translates your intent into a safe regular expression, applies it locally, and lets you switch instantly between matched, excluded, or highlighted views of the same data.
